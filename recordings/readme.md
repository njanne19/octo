# ROS Bag -> Octo Dataset Conversion 
NOTE: This section of the repository is a WIP. At a minimum, you should create two subdirectories here. 

The first: 
```
mkdir bags
```

This stores your ROS bag files 

The second: 
```
mkdir octo_objects
```

This stores your converted Octo dataset files (pickle format)
